Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to a systematic way in which engineering principles, tools and and methods are applied in the creation and maintenance of software applications.
currently, software engineering is at the core of crucial sectors including healthcare, finance, transportation and communication where it is applied in developing software that improves efficiency, accuracy and speed in which services are rendered. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Over the years, software engineering has evolved with the main milestone being the invention and development of programming languages. secondly, the next milestone took place in the 1960s and was marked with the establishment of software engineering as a discipline. The 2000s has been marked by the rise of agile technologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- involves identifying the needs of the software and its system requirements.
2. Design- deals with putting in place the architecture of the software to be developed.
3. implementation- in this phase, the engineer writes code according to the specifications of the design.
4. Testing- conducting quality assurance to assess whether the software meets the needs and specifications.
5. Deployment- putting the software into application.
6. maintenance- performing regular improvements and correcting shortcomings that come from using the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology, the creation of software happens systematically as one stage is exhausted before proceeding to the next stage. On the other hand, Agile follows iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes on flexibility and collaboration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software developer- responsible for writing the code.
2. Quality Assurance- Responsible for designing and implementing the software testing plans and procedures.
3. Project manager- oversees the all process of planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Integrated Development Environments provide an interface where developers write, debug and test their code.
-Version Control System provides developers with tools for tracking changes made on their source code and also an opportunity to collaborate among themselves.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight working deadlines
-Changing needs prompted by either technological advancement or during development.
-technical debts that is caused by shortcuts.
however, the challenges can be minimized through:
-prioritizing tasks
-applying agile methodologies
-effective communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing involes testing of individuals components of a software. 
2. Integration- refers to testing involving different components in the software.
3. system testing- in this case, the system is tested as a whole.
4. acceptance- testing the software visa vis user requirements.
-the above tests are crucial as they help in identifying and fixing issues at early stages of development.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting statements and questions designed to get the best response from an Artificial Intelligence model. It enables the avoidance of vague answers by ensuring that the questions are specific and clear to the AI model.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt is asking, "tell me about operating systems.". We can make the prompt clear by asking the AI model to give information about a specific operating system. For instance, "Tell me about the features of a windows operating system." The improved version is more effective as it allows the AI model to extract information only related to windows operating system.
